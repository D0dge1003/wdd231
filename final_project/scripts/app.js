// scripts/app.js - This is the main entry point to import and run modules.
// Note: The previous logic has been moved into module.js and the main logic 
// to execute them is now inside the DOMContentLoaded listener in module.js itself 
// to simplify the final HTML include.

// Since the new module.js includes the DOMContentLoaded listener, 
// this file is not strictly necessary unless you wanted to keep the functions 
// separate from the execution block. 

// **Recommendation:** Stick with the updated 'module.js' structure 
// and the updated HTML below for simplicity and to meet the ES Module requirement.
