            <h1>The Foundation: Tabletop & Early Consoles</h1>
            <p>The roots of the RPG genre lie in imagination, probability, and social storytelling. Before screens, there was paper, and from that paper came the core concepts that define role-playing games today.</p>

            <p>D&D established the "Holy Trinity" of RPG mechanics: attributes (Strength, Intelligence), leveling up (XP), and class-based roles. It introduced the concept of the Dungeon Master as a narrator, creating a collaborative, emergent narrative that was the first of its kind.</p>

            <h2>Defining Core Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The transition from analog to digital required translating abstract concepts into concrete systems. Three pillars emerged that would define the next two decades of RPG design:</p>

                    <h3>Character Progression</h3>
                    <p>The system of Experience Points (XP) ensuring the player felt tangible growth. Progression provided a clear reward loop, driving players to explore and battle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="border-color: var(--tertiary);">
                    <h3>Inventory & Economy</h3>
                    <p>The concept of collecting and managing gear, items, and currency. This layered system provided depth and strategy outside of pure combat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card" style="border-color: var(--tertiary);">
                    <h3>Statistical Combat</h3>
                    <p>Replacing the physical dice roll with digital probability. Every action was tied to a character's stats, making character building crucial to success.</p>

            <h2>The 8-Bit Revolution 💾</h2>
            <p>As computers became accessible, developers translated D&D rules into code. Early console titles like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest simplified complex math into turn-based combat systems accessible on home consoles, establishing the JRPG sub-genre.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Turn-Based Combat:</strong> Strategic pacing allowing players to plan moves without real-time pressure, directly mirroring the tabletop experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Overworld Maps:</strong> Introduced a sense of global scale and discovery, linking isolated towns and dungeons.</li>
                <li><strong>Grinding:</strong> A core necessity where players repeated battles to gain the necessary power (XP) to overcome narrative walls.</li>
